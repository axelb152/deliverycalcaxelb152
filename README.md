# Wolt Delivery Calculator - Axel Bagenal 

This is my attempt at the frontend specification of the Preliminary Assignment for the Wolt Engineering Intern Positions 2023. I am a fullstack developer who recently graduated from Le Wagon, who's techstack includes: React, Ruby on Rails, Redis, Postgres and more.

## Installation

Install the project with yarn and install :

```bash
  yarn add deliverycalcaxelb152
  cd deliverycalcaxelb152
  yarn 
```
    
The library "antd" should already be included as a dependency in the project package when running the first line of the above code. However, if you cannot see the dependency inside the package.json file then run the following:

```bash
yarn add antd
```

To start the local host, run:

```bash
  yarn start
  ```
## How I would optimize the project

If I had more time to improve on the project, I would do the following:

-Create a more responsive UI, particularly for tablet and smartphone sized viewports

-Update design a bit more, change the margins on the 'Delivery Fee' card and fix spacing on the delivery form. 

-Update the datepicker

-Create logic where delivery fee result is hidden, and when a button 'calculate delivery fee' was implemented, the Delivery Result would show on click. 

-Fix the calculation logic so that the delivery fee can only be rounded to 2 decimal 'cents' if/when the Friday Surcharge is implemented. 

-I have not used ANTD design library prior to this project, I would definitely like to delve more into the documentation and have some more practice with it.
